# Doomsday Organizer

This is an extended to-do application that will help the user better manage their tasks. The user is able to enter tasks, click and drag the tasks anywhere in the page, delete tasks and edit them. When the user attempts to leave the browser or refresh the page, a warning should display. The to-dos will also still exist when the user leaves the page and re-open it in the same browser session.
